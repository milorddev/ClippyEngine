2. Feedback and Contributions

If you provide the Company with any Feedback, the Company is free to use the Feedback however it chooses.  If you make any Contribution available to the Company, you hereby assign to the Company all right, title, and interest (including all copyright, patent, and other intellectual property rights) in that Contribution for all current and future use.  If any of those rights are not effectively assigned under applicable law, you hereby grant the Company a non-exclusive, fully-paid, irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable license to reproduce, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, make, use, have made, sell, offer to sell, import, modify and make derivative works based on, and otherwise exploit that Contribution for all current and future use.  If any of those rights may not be assigned or licensed under applicable law (such as moral and other personal rights), you hereby waive and agree not to assert all of those rights.  However, you may continue to freely use any Feedback that you provide to the Company, and you may continue to use, in any manner consistent with the License, any Contribution that you make available to the Company.

You understand and agree that the Company is not required to make any use of any Feedback or Contribution that you provide.  You agree that if the Company makes use of your Feedback or Contribution, the Company is not required to credit or compensate you for your contribution.

You represent and warrant that you have sufficient rights in any Feedback or Contribution that you provide to the Company to grant the Company and other affected parties the rights described above.  This includes but is not limited to intellectual property rights and other proprietary or personal rights.


3. Ownership

The Company owns all title, ownership rights, and intellectual property rights in the Product.  You own all rights in the products you develop under the License, other than that which attributes to the Product.  All rights granted to you under this Agreement are granted by express license only and not by sale, and all of those rights are limited by the terms of this Agreement. Any attempted sublicense under this Agreement that is not consistent with the terms of this Agreement will be null and void. 


4. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability

The Product and all other materials and information provided by the Company ("Company Materials") are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis, "with all faults" and without warranty of any kind. The Company and its affiliates make no warranty that any of the the Company Materials will operate properly or that any defect in the Company Materials can and will be corrected. There is no warranty that Company Materials will meet your requirements, will be in compliance with a platform manufacturer’s rules or requirements, or operate in an uninterrupted, bug free, or error free way in any or all circumstances. The Company, its licensors, and its and their affiliates do not guarantee continuous, error-free, virus-free, or secure operation of or access to the Company Materials.  This paragraph will apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. 

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, neither the Company, nor its affiliates, nor any of the Company’s service providers, shall be liable in any way for loss or damage of any kind resulting from the use or inability to use the Company Materials or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, including but not limited to loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses.  In no event will the Company, nor its affiliates be liable for any loss of profits or any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages, or any other damages arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Company Materials, or the delay or inability to use or lack of functionality of the Company Materials, even in the event of the Company’s or its affiliates’ fault, tort (including negligence), strict liability, indemnity, product liability, breach of contract, breach of warranty, or otherwise and even if the Company or its affiliates have been advised of the possibility of such damages.  These limitations and exclusions regarding damages apply even if any remedy fails to provide adequate compensation.

Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in those states or jurisdictions, the foregoing limitations of liability shall apply only to the full extent permitted by law.


5. Third Party Software

 The Product may include Third Party Software components. By entering into this Agreement and using Third Party Software, you are accepting the terms of those licenses.  In this case, the Third Party Software terms will govern your use of the Third Party Software, and if there is inconsistency, those terms will take precedence over the terms of the License for the Third Party Software.  You agree that the owners of the Third Party Software are intended third party beneficiaries to this Agreement in relation to your uses of Third Party Software.  


6. New Versions and Content

During the term of your License, you will be entitled to access future versions of the Product that the Company chooses to make available to you.  The Company does not have any obligation to make new versions of the Product available, nor does the Company have any obligation to continue to make available for access or download any or all versions of the Product.  However, any versions of the Product that the Company has made available to you are considered part of the Product and may be used as defined by the License Agreement.


7. Royalty

You agree to pay the Company a royalty equal to 5% of all worldwide gross revenue actually attributable to each creation made by you ("User Creation"), regardless of whether that revenue is received by you or any other person or legal entity, as follows:

     a.  Gross revenue resulting from any and all sales of a User Creation to end users through any and all media, including but not limited to digital and retail;
     b.  Gross revenue resulting from any and all in-app purchases, downloadable content, microtransactions, subscriptions, sale, transfer, or exchange of content created by end users for use with a User Creation, or redemption of virtual currency, either within a User Creation or made externally but which directly affect the operation of the User Creation;
     c.  Gross revenue from any Kickstarter or other crowdfunding campaign which is directly associated with User Creation access (e.g., in a multi-tiered campaign, if an amount is established in an early tier solely for User Creation access, your royalty obligation will apply to that amount for each backer with the same access, but not on additional amounts in higher tiers based on ancillary benefits);
     d.  Your revenue from in-app advertising and affiliate programs;
     e.  Revenue from advance payments for a User Creation (from a publisher or otherwise); and
     f.  Revenue in any other form actually attributable to a User Creation (unless excluded below).

However, no royalty is owed on the following forms of revenue:

     1.  The first $3,000.00 in gross revenue for each User Creation per calendar quarter;
     2.  Consulting fees or work-for-hire fees which are non-recoupable for services performed using the Product (e.g., an architect-created walkthrough simulation or a contractor-developed in-house training simulator);
     3.  Revenue from ancillary products which are not software and which do not contain embedded information (such as QR codes) which affects the operation of the User Creation (e.g., comic books, soundtracks, apparel); 
     4.  Financial winnings generated by awards for the User Creation;
     5.  Revenue from donations for a User Creation which are not tied to User Creation access or in-User Creation benefits; 
     6.  Any revenue generated from a User Creation if the entity receiving payment is a legal Non-Profit Organization; 
     7.  Revenue collected from an end-user buyer of in-game items or other in-game content for your User Creation which is sold by an end-user seller and which is actually paid to the end-user seller and is not retained by you or any other party.

The royalty is based on gross revenue from end users, regardless of whether you sell your User Creation to end users directly, self-publish via the App Store or any similar store, or work with a publisher.  The following simplified example illustrates the application of the royalty to gross sales:  if your User Creation earns $10 on the App Store, Apple may pay you $7 (having deducted 30% as a distribution fee), but your royalty to the Company would still be 5% of $10 (or $0.50).

Royalties that you pay on an advance payment of revenue for a User Creation that is recoupable by the payer, such as a publisher, may be credited against future royalty payments that you incur under this Agreement for that User Creation.

Royalties must be reported and paid on a per-User Creation basis.  The $3,000 per User Creation per calendar quarter royalty exemption may not be aggregated across multiple User Creations.

Within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter in which a User Creation earns revenue outside of the above-listed royalty exclusions, you must pay to the Company the full amount of the royalty due for that quarter and send the Company a royalty report on a per User Creation basis.

The royalty will be payable under this Agreement with respect to each User Creation for as long as any Engine Code or Content (including as modified by you under the License) incorporated in or used to make the User Creation are protected under copyright or other applicable intellectual property law.
