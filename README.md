The Clippy Engine is a unique game engine. It aims to provide truely interactive experiences and allow characters and events to DIRECTLY affect your desktop environment and file systems.

For most games, you play inside of a Window, interacting only with what is made for you. With the Clippy Engine, you can make games OUTSIDE the window, and have your game interact with other parts of the computer.

Imagine
  - Enemy troops coming to invade your desktop by opening a portal on your internet icon.
  - Using the file system to organize and construct a base
  - Have Mario use the windows on your computer as platforms to jump on
 
Allow yourself to build something truely original, with the Clippy Engine.
